Move fast without breaking things: three practices for game development

A personal history of naive development


Apply data-driven development
- Separate or expose variables and data away from logic: assets, events, text
- "No hardcoding"; also applies to art and animation assets


See progress through daily builds

Invest in specialized tooling
- You can't buy everything, and even after you buy something, you still have to customize it
- A game engine doesn't make games - people do
- Integrate with the environment that role is most comfortable in
- Automate anything you do manually and repeatedly
