  Ticket deflection is an automated workflow wherein support tickets are deflected by first serving documentation. A ticket is **deflected** when a user is able to solve their problems independently, without a support engineer.

  Ticket deflection enables support teams to allocate resources to more complex issues. It is also used to measure the impact of documentation and identify gaps.
