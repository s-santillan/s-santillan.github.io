# Ticket deflection

Ticket deflection is an automated workflow wherein support tickets are deflected by first serving documentation. A ticket is **deflected** when a user is able to solve their problems independently, without a support engineer, by using the provided docs. Ticket deflection enables support teams to allocate resources to more complex issues.

Ticket deflection is also used to measure the impact of documentation and identify gaps.
