# Ticket deflection

Ticket deflection is an automated workflow wherein support tickets are deflected by first serving documentation. The more tickets are deflected, that is, the more users are able to solve their problems independently, the better.

Ticket deflection is thus a metric that can be used to measure the impact of documentation. It can also be used to identify gaps in communication.
