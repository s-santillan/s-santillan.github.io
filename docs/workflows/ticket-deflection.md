# Ticket deflection

Ticket deflection is an automated workflow wherein support tickets are deflected by first serving documentation. A ticket is **deflected** when a user is able to solve their problems independently. Ticket deflection enables support teams to allocate resources to more complex issues.

Ticket deflection is also a metric that can be used to measure the impact of documentation.
