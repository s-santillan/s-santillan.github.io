# In pursuit of creativity, you can't separate ideation from execution

### _Draw, paint, or assemble studies by hand—Artists must experiment—Don't give in to slop_

Generative AI (Gen AI) has been around for a while, but in recent years it has become more accessible and harder to distinguish from human-drawn art. Creatives and non-creatives alike are integrating this technology into their processes at work.

This post explores the value of draftsmanship, assemblage, and painting as necessary skills with which to wield Gen AI:

- Recognizing that these skills are a crucial means to develop creativity in any person that has to be practiced and maintained, even though it takes time on the job.
- Trusting creatives to decide when they need to do something manually—slowly, even, and trusting them to know when to automate parts of their job with Gen AI.

For example, manually editing or making a graphic by hand can take hours. Once the **concept** has been determined, the next step is to **execute**. Where once you would have to spend a certain amount of time to execute something, now you can use a prompt and, if you're a creative, clean up the rough edges (say, illegible text or awkward perspective).

It could also be argued that if your work as a graphic designer includes rote graphic manipulation, say, improving the image of a product then cropping it for ten different image specs for different online shopping sites, Gen AI can take away the tedious repetition of resizing and editing the work.

That being said, drawing something by hand contributes to two skills necessary to make use of Gen AI:

- **Conceptualization**. Before you execute, you need a concept. Drawing by hand improves this.
- **Vocabulary building and reasoning**. The person making the prompt has to have a good vocabulary (perspective, palette, typography) to set up the Gen AI for success.

## Conceptualization: when you look at art you are looking at a thousand choices

If you ask any digital artist or graphic designer what their most used shortcut is, there's a good chance they'll say <kbd>Ctrl+Z</kbd>. The undo button. They draw something, then they erase and redraw it. They nudge something, then they go back to a previous position.

They're constantly iterating. They're asking themselves: _Does this look good? Why does it look bad? What if I tried this in another perspective? What if I emphasized this bit?_

The generative AI makes these decisions for the prompter, hiding these variables. Artists, especially new ones, risk losing awareness of these factors. The possibility space shrinks because of a lack of visibility. They don't get to practice the muscle of stretching that space till it bursts.

With every conscious choice, a concept becomes clearer. If you're conveying apprehension on a human face, what pose do they strike? Are they pulling their hair? Are they biting their nails? Are they grimacing? That's why artists draw **studies** before they commit to the next step. When making a comic book, you start with pencils before committing to ink.

Can Gen AI be used in this step? Of course it can, not necessarily as the finished product itself. Instead, AI is used to help generate ideas, references, or elements that are manipulated by the artist.

## Vocabulary matters

What is a dead-on perspective? What is _damashi itten_? What about the Kubrick stare, or the pieta? Would a fisheye view work well with our apprehensive human face? What about a bird's-eye view?

Art has a vast vocabulary; how do artists learn these things? They learn by drawing these techniques to see for themselves their effect. An artist's recall of a particular compositional technique or color palette depends on how familiar they are with it, how much time and experience they've spent with it.

Without this language, there is a limit to the variety that can be achieved with the prompt. A prompt needs this language; lacking it, your prompted output looks no different from a hundred others.

## "Letting" artists, designers, creatives draw

Now that we've established why manual art skills matter, we can tackle the elephant in the room: speed. The implication of GenAI's near-instant output is that artists should work faster, or that one artist can do the work of three at the same amount of time. While Gen AI can be used to automate a lot of repetitive work (like cropping something for ten different image specifications) its utility in other phases of creative work is limited.

How limited? That depends on your artist and the type of work they're doing. This is the hard part: the part where creatives need to be listened to with regards to the limitations of Gen AI. It is not a magic asset-making thing. Sometimes having to correct the assets it makes takes more time than drawing the asset from scratch itself. The only way to know is by talking to your artists.

## Closing thoughts

Not everything needs to be hand drawn, but neither should our use of technology contribute to the devaluation of manual art skills.
