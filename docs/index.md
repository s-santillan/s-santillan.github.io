# Welcome

Hello and welcome to **Ergonomic Communication**, a personal site about technical writing and developer tools.

## The author

I'm Sara, a technical writer by day and amorphous tech generalist by night. Many of the posts here are my explorations into finding pleasant, efficient, and ethical ways to work with and learn from the modern web.

## Writing tools

- `nvim` for writing
- `draw.io` for diagrams

No LLMs have been used to generate content of any kind for this blog. I'm the technical writer, after allâ€”I write what the LLMs are trained on.
